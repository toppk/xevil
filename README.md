== Status == G'NUFF
if: 
 on 64bit linux with c++/x11/xpm libraries
run:
 checkout + make 
creates:
 xevil binary

== Why?
# everyone deserves to play xevil

== Project Plan
# start with last released version http://www.xevil.com/download/stable/xevilsrc2.02r2.zip
# make work
# publish
# hack as needed

== Rules for Project
* support only what you use (rm -rf win32)

== Ideas
* warnings are not evil
* wayland is coming
* lots of text is too hard to read (poor contrast?)
* try multiuser
* capture xevil.com content
* sound
