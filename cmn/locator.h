// "locator.h" The object locator.  


/* Overview: 
The locator can be seen as the collection of all physical objects in
the game.  It draws all objects with the draw method.  The clock
method goes through all the phases of one turn for all objects.  This
is the only entity in the game that has a list of all the objects.
Objects can be mapped and/or collidable.  An unmapped object is
neither drawn nor collided.  An uncollidable object is drawn (if
mapped) but not collided.  There is a message queue that objects can
use to communicate with the ui object.  The locator does not need to
be clocked for the queue to work. 
The locator grid is the maximum size of the world.  I.e. it can be larger than
the world. */
